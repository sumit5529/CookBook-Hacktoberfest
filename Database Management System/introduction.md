# What is DBMS

Database Management System (DBMS) is a collection of programs which enables its users to access a database, manipulate data and reporting/representation of data.

## Why to Learn DBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System) plays a major role in software engineering.
In each industry, from smaller firms to higher-level organizations which uses softwares, must need DBMS for data management which can be only operated by a person who knows DBMS very well.
So there are huge opportunities for the people who have a better knowledge of DBMS.
DBMS helps businesses to better organize their data by providing various features like :

1. Real world entities
2. Table creation based on relations
3. Data isolation & protection
4. Consistency
5. Less redundancy
6. Query processing

## Applications of Database Management System

1. Banking: for storing customer information, account activities, deposits, payment details, loans, etc.

2. Manufacturing: for supply chain management, production tracking and inventory management

3. Finance: for storing information about stocks, sales, and purchases of financial instruments like stocks and bonds

4. Universities: for student information, course registrations, payroll and grades

5. Airlines: for reservations, ticket booking and schedule information

## Advantages of DBMS

1. DBMS offers various techniques and powerful functions to efficiently store & retrieve data

2. DBMS serves as an efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data

3. Provides Uniform administration procedures for data management

4. Application programmers never exposed to details of data representation and storage

5. Offers Data Integrity and Security

6. DBMS implies integrity constraints to get a high level of protection against prohibited access to data

7. DBMS schedules concurrent access to the data in such a manner that only one user can access the same data at a time

8. Reduces Application Development Time

## Disadvantages of DBMS

1. Hardware and Software cost of a DBMS is quite high which increases the budget of your organization

2. Most database management systems are often complex systems, so the training for users to use the DBMS is required

3. In some organizations, all data is integrated into a single database which may cause the damage because of electric failure or database can be corrupted on the storage media

4. Use of the same program at a time by many users sometimes lead to the loss of some data

5. DBMS canâ€™t perform sophisticated calculations
