## **About Icon Button Widget**

[Click here to check in official docs of Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material)

An IconButton is a picture printed on the Material widget. It is a useful widget that gives the Flutter UI a material design feel. We can also customize the look and feel of this button. In simple terms, it is an icon that reacts when the user will touch it.

## **Essential Properties Of Icon Button Widget**

**Alignment:**
Defines how the icon is positioned within the IconButton.

**Autofocus:**
True if this widget will be selected as the initial focus when no other node in its scope is currently focused.

**Color:**
The color to use for the icon inside the button, if the icon is enabled. Defaults to leaving this up to the icon widget.

**Constraints:**
Optional size constraints for the button.

**DisabledColor:**
The color to use for the icon inside the button, if the icon is disabled. Defaults to the ThemeData.disabledColor of the current Theme.

**EnableFeedback:**
Whether detected gestures should provide acoustic and/or haptic feedback.

**FocusColor:**
The color for the button when it has the input focus.

**FocusNode:**
An optional focus node to use as the focus node for this widget.

**HashCode:**
The hash code for this object.

**HighlightColor:**
The secondary color of the button when the button is in the down (pressed) state. The highlight color is represented as a solid color that is overlaid over the button color (if any). If the highlight color has transparency, the button color will show through. The highlight fades in quickly as the button is held down.

**HoverColor:**
The color for the button when a pointer is hovering over it.

**Icon:**
The icon to display inside the button.

**IconSize:**
The size of the icon inside the button.

**IsSelected:** â†’ bool?
The optional selection state of the icon button.

**MouseCursor:**
The cursor for a mouse pointer when it enters or is hovering over the button.

**OnPressed:**
The callback that is called when the button is tapped or otherwise activated.

**Padding:**
The padding around the button's icon. The entire padded icon will react to input gestures.

**RuntimeType:**
A representation of the runtime type of the object.

**SelectedIcon:**
The icon to display inside the button when isSelected is true. This property can be null. The original icon will be used for both selected and unselected status if it is null.

**SplashRadius:**
The splash radius.

**Style:**
Customizes this button's appearance.

**Tooltip:**
Text that describes the action that will occur when the button is pressed.

**VisualDensity:**
Defines how compact the icon button's layout will be.

***

## **Important points to be noted:**

* The hit region of an icon button will, if possible, be at least **kMinInteractiveDimension** pixels in size, regardless of the actual iconSize, to satisfy the touch target size requirements in the Material Design specification. The alignment controls how the icon itself is positioned within the hit region.

* If the onPressed callback is **null**, then the button will be disabled and will not react to touch.
