# **Kruskal's Algorithm**

1. It is used for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

2. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

3. Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which

-> form a tree that includes every vertex
-> has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph

**Working**
It falls under a class of algorithms called greedy algorithms that find the local optimum in the hopes of finding a global optimum.

We start from the edges with the lowest weight and keep adding edges until we reach our goal.

The steps for implementing Kruskal's algorithm are as follows:

1. Sort all the edges from low weight to high
2. Take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree. If adding the edge created a cycle, then reject this edge.
3. Keep adding edges until we reach all vertices.

```
input 
m = 4
(0,1,10)
(1,3,15)
(2,3,4)
(2,0,6)
(0,3,5)
```

```
Output
Following are the edges in the constructed MST
2 -- 3 == 4
0 -- 3 == 5
0 -- 1 == 10
Minimum Cost Spanning Tree: 19
